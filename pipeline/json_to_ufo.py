"""Convert a Glyph Studio project (.glyphstudio.json) into UFO font sources.

Usage:
    python3 json_to_ufo.py MyFont.glyphstudio.json build/

Then compile with fontmake:
    fontmake -u build/MyFont-Regular.ufo -o ttf --output-dir build/

What this adds beyond the in-browser draft TTF:
  * standard UFO source (one .glif per glyph) — diffable, PR-able, editable
    in any font editor (Fontra, FontForge, Glyphs, RoboFont)
  * auto-generated OpenType features for the mym2 shaping model:
      - blwf: subjoined (stacked) consonant substitutions  (က + ္ + က → stack)
      - rphf: kinzi
      - contextual variants (wide medial-ra, short u/uu) when drawn
  * mark anchors (top/bottom on bases, _top/_bottom plus a stacking anchor
    on marks) so ufo2ft's MarkFeatureWriter emits GPOS mark/mkmk positioning
    at build time.

Anchors are auto-placed from the ink; positions dragged in the studio's
anchor mode (stored per glyph as "anchors": {name: [x, y]}) override the
auto placement. The UFO stays editable in any font editor for finer work.

Stroke-to-outline expansion mirrors web/js/outline.js — keep them in sync.

    The base does NOT have to end before the wrap's ink does: in
    traditional designs the narrow hook finishes over the base's right
    shoulder, with the base poking a little past it. Calibrated against
    Padauk's own narrow/wide split measured on the traced sample project:
    every base Padauk keeps narrow overhangs the wrap by at most ~73
    units, every base it widens overhangs by 136+ — so 100 splits the
